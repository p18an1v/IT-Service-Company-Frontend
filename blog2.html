                        This article is all about the rise of a potential empire you today know as Almond Group. As every heart as up’s and down’s same the Almond had with me. I think this name, and we both were attached to me before my birth. It all started with a story, I was a little boy who got early access to computers and the internet in his early life, as always I was not a sports guy, I do always spend my time reading, gaming, and having most of the time on my PC learning things from Youtube and practically implementing them like hacking 350 Facebook accounts of my diploma mates. I was born within a middle-class family and we do have a family business, so you can promptly say I have a business background and I used it wisely.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        Let’s get back to the story, I registered Almond Group in 2018 as an MSME startup. But the business model was way different than we had today. The thing was I wanted to make this company product-oriented rather than service, I started to work on it making research, arranging people, everything. I was very fond of Investors back then because I thought they are the ones who can provide me resources, money, and network possibly everything. I went to every possible powerful person I know to Invest in it, I went to builders, I went to politicians, I went to institutes and incubation centers i.e every possible door and they slammed hard on me. I wanted to make an app name “JUDO”. An app that can drastically change India, an app to provide employment to every needy, an app that can provide any possible work to people besides me. I had estimated calculations of rising GDP, potential revenue, and stats of every possible thing in billions. Ya! I was daydreaming to change the world and still, I do. Literally, I was not willing to my bachelor’s due to this idea. You know the sleepless nights when an idea sticks right? The struggle to convince my parents. The dream and all the things, but as my well-wishers and my parents told it was not your decision, it’s an order to get the degree after all it’s an emotional thing.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        I landed in Lonavala, you have heard the place right? It’s nothing but a beautiful bed with roses having thorns which I didn’t know, a party place or a chill place, for a child like me who has come directly from a village to such an open-minded place, woww it was hard to believe that girls do smoke back then! Ya you can laugh, but I was such a well frog. The start was bitter, but soon I had a family there and it started to feel like home. I’m very bad at programming, though I have Computer Science Degree. Literally so bad that I can’t remember a single line of code as of now and yet I have a software company. It’s funny, right? But generally, life doesn’t generally allow you to predict it and that’s why it’s life. The famous quote, just connect the dots one day it will have some meaning, and literally when I look back in life I really feel the meaning of every possible thing that happened to me. Engineering had taught me one thing and I’m really thankful for it, and that’s life. I had a very rough past back there but ya that was the rocket that placed me in the space in my orbit.
